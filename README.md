# [DOG STAGRAM](https://dog-stagram-23b178208419.herokuapp.com)

Welcome to dogstagram.
A website I thought in real life would be a fun thing for people who love dogs to get involved in. People love their pets as if they are family, and some look at their pets like they are their children. So creating a competition based website, for users to enter pictures of their furry children, to win prizes and (eventually have a meetup group) seemed like a good idea for me.

Almost that if this was a real life website, people would actually take part, and enjoy being part of a group who also shared a love for their pets.
Although I do not have a dog anymore, I stop to rub every single dog I see, I think it is built into us to love them!

## UX

In choosing the design process for this project, I wanted  to keep it simple. Easy for the user to manoeuvre around without hassel. Having the website in plain colour scheme, black text for good readability for users of all ages. 
I thought of users who would be used to social media type of apps, while still giving the simplistic look of what you see, is what you get with the website. 
My aim was to keep it neat and tidy, not too much to pull away from the fact that it is all about the cute dog images that are added to the site.

### Colour Scheme

For the colours, I chose beige background, and kept the same coloir across all the different pages to keep persistence throughout the site.

- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#EBD6B6` used for all backgrounds
- `#F2CC9B` used for navbar and buttons.
- `#512E10` used for social media icons.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ebd6b6-f2cc9b-512e10-000000) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

For the fonts, I chose a friendly easily readable font. PT Sans stood out to me to be a simple font, that wouldn't be harsh to the eye for users to look and read.

- [PT Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans) was used for the primary headers, titles and paragraph texts.

## User Stories

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to be informed straight away, so that I can know exactly what the site is for.
- As a new site user, I would like to be given straight forward instruction, so that I can know where to go on the site and how to navigate it.
- As a new site user, I would like all of the pages in one obvious section, so that I can work my way around the site easily.
- As a new site user, I would like the site to be simple and straight forward, so that no matter my age, I can make sense of what to do and where to go on the site.
- As a new site user, I would like to feel included and happy with my experience, so that I can feel confident returning.
- As a new site user, I would like to have the option to edit/update, so that I can update the photo.
- As a new site user, I would like to have the option to delete, so that I can delete the photo.
- As a new site user, I would like to have the option to vote without adding my own dog, so that I can feel involved.

### Returning Site Users

- As a returning site user, I would like to be brought back to the same home page, so that I can reread anything if I need to be reminded of what to do.
- As a returning site user, I would like to have the option of adding another dog, so that if I got another pet I can add them too the competition..
- As a returning site user, I would like the site to remain similar enough, so that I can move around the site as I had previously.


### Site Admin

- As a site administrator, I should be able to have access to the site, so that I can keep a good maintance on the website.
- As a site administrator, I should be able to an eye on all that is uploaded, so that I can ensure a safe environment for users.
- As a site administrator, I should be able to see what users post, so that I can delete from admin page if called for.

## Features

Features I have in this project, having the user to create a website and login.
If they do not have an account, and want to get involved in the compeition, or even vote,  they are suggested to sign up.
When they user logs in, they are brought to the home page which explains what the site is designed for, and informed on the prizes up for grabs.
When the user wants to join in, there is a drop down toggle button waiting to be clicked in the navbar.
When the user clicks the drop down, it in put in order of the steps they should take in order to get involved in the fun.
Add their dog, which brings them to a page that has the dogs name, breed and dob.
Add your photo, when they come here their information should be stored on the database, so they can click their own dog and not get every persons dog name. They also have the image slot that will bring them to their own files and they can upload their image. Then they select the compeition.
Once the user has entered their dog and their photo, they are brought to see that their photo has indeed uploaded on the competition page, along with their dogs name and with the option to update or delete their photo.
Along with this , the user can also vote for other pets to win!

### Existing Features

- **Register**

    - The user can only join in on the compeition if they register, which will prompt the user to return, considering they have signed up for the site.

![screenshot](documentation/feature01.png)

- **Add your dog**

    - Giving the user the option to add their own dog, with their name, breed and d.o.b, so that when they go to the add your photo page, it's simpler for them.

![screenshot](documentation/feature02.png)

- **Add your photo**

    - Here the user can click the dropdown beside dog, to find their dogs name and not everyone elses. 

![screenshot](documentation/feature03.png)

- **Drop down toggle navbar**

    -  I added a dropdown toggle to the navbar , as I felt the navbar was getting very busy. I think it looks neater for users.
	
	![screenshot](documentation/feature04.png)

- **Edit / Delete**

    -  I gave the users the option to edit or delete their image from the compeition.
![screenshot](documentation/feature05.png)


### Future Features

For future features I would like to have more style added to the site overall.  Also having past winners added to a section, with the winners images posted on the home page.

- Winners
    - Post the past winners onto the home page of the previous month.
- Styling
    - More sectional style to parts of the project.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/shellym96/dog-stagram/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shellym96/dog-stagram/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.


- [Open Issues](https://github.com/shellym96/dog-stagram/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)

    ![screenshot](documentation/open-issues.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/shellym96/dog-stagram/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://dog-stagram-23b178208419.herokuapp.com).

### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:

- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: dog-stagram).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shellym96/dog-stagram) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it
